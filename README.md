Compressed FTIR spectroscopy using low-rank matrix reconstruction
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.404959


## References

This repository contains the python code that is used in the paper 
* [1] Compressed FTIR spectroscopy using low-rank matrix reconstruction, Optics Express Vol. 28, Issue 26, pp. 38762-38772 (2020) 


## Motivation
Reducing measurement times and datasets by implementing reconstruction methods is a usual mathematical tool.
In this project we develop a regularized low-rank matrix recovery algorithm to account for smoothness, sparsity and low-rank properties of the given data.

## Installation 

To run the library one needs a $\geq$ python 3.6 installation with the python packages
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib

### Installation using pip

Install via the python package manager `pip` using

```
  pip install compressedftir
```
### Basic Python installation 

Guides to install python under Linux, Windows and Mac can be found here: https://realpython.com/installing-python/

### Quick guide for Python under Windows:

1. Download Python https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-382/ (bottom of the page: "Windows x86-64 executable installer") 
2. Install Python using the installer and check "Add Python x.x to Path"
3. Run a terminal, e.g. CMD
4. Check the installation by typing

	```
	python
	```
   a command prompt should appear such as 

	```
	C:\Users\Marschall\Projects\CompressedFTIR>python
	Python 3.8.2 (tags/v3.8.2:7b3ab59, Feb 25 2020, 22:45:29) [MSC v.1916 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
	Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
	>>>
	```


5. Close the Python prompt using
	```
	exit()
	```
6. Install dependencies
	```
	python -m pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
	```

## Implementation details

Some features and important files are mentioned in the following

* `paper_leishmania/run_recon.py` is a run script and contains a dummy 2D example using an l-curve criterion for choosing the regularization parameter in a smoothed matrix reconstruction approach. You should get started here. Other scripts in this directory require additional data that are not available online.
* `compressedftir.datareader` implements a variety of data formats and can be adapted to your file format
* `compressedftir.reconstruction.lowrank` implements the code that is described in the paper [1]
